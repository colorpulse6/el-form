- 5d34a7d: Add pre-compiled CSS support for zero-configuration styling

  This release introduces optional pre-compiled Tailwind CSS that allows developers to use beautiful, professionally-styled forms without requiring Tailwind CSS installation.

  **Key Features:**

  - Pre-compiled CSS export via `./styles.css`
  - Import `"el-form-react-components/styles.css"` for instant styling
  - 31KB minified CSS with semantic `.el-form-*` classes
  - Professional gradient buttons, rounded inputs, focus states, and error styling
  - Backwards compatible - existing Tailwind class approach continues to work

  **Technical Improvements:**

  - Build process includes CSS compilation via `@tailwindcss/cli`
  - Enhanced AutoForm component with semantic CSS classes
  - Comprehensive semantic class system for customization
  - Updated package.json exports to include styles.css

  **Documentation:**

  - Updated changelog and sidebar navigation
  - Added migration examples and usage guides

  This feature is perfect for developers who want beautiful forms out-of-the-box without the complexity of setting up Tailwind CSS in their projects.
