# üß™ Manual Testing Guide for el-form-ai

This guide will help you manually test all AI features in the el-form library.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Step 1: Start the Mock MCP Server

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start the AI backend
cd examples/mcp-server
pnpm install
pnpm start
```

The server will start on `http://localhost:3000` and provide mock AI responses.

### Step 2: Start the React Development Server

```bash
# Terminal 2: Start the frontend
pnpm dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:5173` to see the demo interface.

## üéØ Testing Scenarios

### 1. AI Form Builder

**Location**: Top of the demo page - "ü§ñ AI Form Builder" tab

**Test Cases:**

- **Basic Generation**: Type "Create a contact form with name, email, and phone"
- **Complex Generation**: Type "Create an e-commerce checkout form with billing address, payment method, and order notes"
- **Domain-Specific**: Type "Create a patient registration form for a healthcare clinic"

**Expected Results:**

- Form generates with appropriate fields
- Validation rules are applied
- Styling matches the requested domain

### 2. Smart AutoForm Enhancement

**Location**: "Smart AutoForm" tab

**Test Cases:**

- **Field Suggestions**: Enable "Field Suggestions" and interact with the form
- **AI Validation**: Fill out fields and see enhanced validation messages
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Watch form improve as you interact with it

**Expected Results:**

- Real-time suggestions appear
- Better error messages show up
- Form gets smarter over time

### 3. AI Form Preview

**Location**: "AI Form Preview" tab

**Test Cases:**

- **Form Approval**: Generate a form and approve it
- **Form Rejection**: Generate a form and reject it
- **Form Modification**: Request modifications to generated forms

**Expected Results:**

- Preview shows generated form accurately
- Actions work as expected
- Modifications are reflected

## üîß Advanced Testing

### Testing with Different MCP Servers

1. **Real AI Integration** (requires API keys):

   ```typescript
   const mcpConfig = {
     endpoint: "https://your-ai-api.com",
     apiKey: "your-api-key",
     model: "claude-3-sonnet",
   };
   ```

2. **Custom Mock Responses**:
   Edit `examples/mcp-server/server.js` to test specific scenarios.

### Testing Error Handling

1. **Server Offline**: Stop the MCP server and test error states
2. **Invalid Responses**: Modify server to return malformed data
3. **Network Issues**: Use browser dev tools to simulate network failures

### Performance Testing

1. **Large Forms**: Generate forms with 20+ fields
2. **Rapid Requests**: Make multiple AI requests quickly
3. **Memory Usage**: Monitor browser memory with large forms

## üêõ Debugging

### Common Issues

1. **"Cannot connect to MCP server"**

   - Ensure MCP server is running on port 3000
   - Check browser console for CORS errors

2. **"AI generation failed"**

   - Check MCP server logs
   - Verify request format in Network tab

3. **Form not rendering**
   - Check browser console for Zod validation errors
   - Verify schema format from AI response

### Debug Tools

1. **Browser DevTools**:

   - Network tab: Check AI API calls
   - Console: View detailed error messages
   - React DevTools: Inspect component state

2. **MCP Server Logs**:
   ```bash
   cd examples/mcp-server
   pnpm dev  # Shows detailed logs
   ```

### Logging

The MCP server logs all requests for debugging:

```bash
# View logs
cd examples/mcp-server
tail -f server.log
```

## üéØ Success Criteria

A successful manual test should demonstrate:

- ‚úÖ AI generates forms that match user intent
- ‚úÖ Enhanced forms provide better UX than standard forms
- ‚úÖ Error handling is robust and user-friendly
