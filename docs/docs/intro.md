# Introduction

Welcome to **El Form** - an elegant, type-safe React form library powered by Zod.

## What is El Form?

El Form is a React library that makes building forms simple, elegant, and type-safe. Built on top of Zod for schema validation, it provides both auto-generated forms and flexible custom form components.

## Key Features

- 🔥 **Auto Form Generation** - Generate complete forms from Zod schemas
- 🛡️ **Type Safety** - Full TypeScript support with runtime validation
- ⚡ **Performance** - Optimized for speed with minimal re-renders
- 🎨 **Customizable** - Flexible styling and component overrides
- 📦 **Lightweight** - Small bundle size with zero dependencies
- 🔧 **Developer Experience** - Intuitive API with great TypeScript inference

## Philosophy

El Form is built on the principle that forms should be:

1. **Simple to create** - Minimal boilerplate for common use cases
2. **Type-safe by default** - Catch errors at compile time, not runtime
3. **Flexible when needed** - Easy to customize without fighting the library
4. **Performant** - Fast validation and rendering
