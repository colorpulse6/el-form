# Changelog

All notable changes to the el-form project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [4.2.0] - 2025-08-24

### ✨ Changes

- FormSwitch (anchored API): `values` tuple is now optional. Provide a readonly tuple (`as const`) to enable compile-time duplicate detection and exhaustiveness checks. No breaking changes.

## [4.1.0] - 2025-08-16

### ✨ New Features

- Selector-based subscriptions to minimize re-renders

  - New hooks in `el-form-react-hooks`:
    - `useFormSelector(selector, equality?)`: subscribe to a selected slice of form state
    - `useField(path)`: subscribe to `{ value, error, touched }` for a field path
  - Export `shallowEqual` for common array/object selector equality
  - SSR-safe snapshots: server snapshot equals client initial selector result

- `FormSwitch` optimization (in `el-form-react-components`)
  - New props: `field?: Path<T>` and `select?: (state) => string | number | boolean`
  - Re-renders only when the discriminator changes
  - Deprecated (back-compat for one minor): `on` and `form` props; dev-only `console.warn`

### 🧪 Examples & Tests

- Added examples under `examples/react/tests` demonstrating `field`, `select`, back-compat, and `useField` re-render isolation
- Added unit tests for selector subscriptions and `FormSwitch` runtime behavior

### 📚 Docs

- Updated `Conditional Rendering (FormSwitch)` guide to prefer `field`/`select`
- Updated `Field Components API` for new `FormSwitch` props
- Updated `useForm` API with selector subscription guidance and `shallowEqual` note
- Updated `useForm` API to reflect strict `register<Name extends Path<T>>` typing (no string fallback). Invalid paths now error; array paths are supported when valid.

## [4.0.0] - 2025-08-12

### ⚠️ Breaking

- Require `zod@^4.0.0`. If you are on Zod 3, upgrade with `pnpm add zod@^4`.

### ✨ Changes

- Internal: Zod 4 introspection (no breaking surface changes to AutoForm/useForm APIs).
- Discriminated unions: more robust introspection; behavior unchanged for users.
- TypeScript: `useForm.register` is now type-safe for known paths
  - Literal field names and dot-paths infer exact field value type and return the appropriate props (`value`, `checked`, or `files`).
  - Dynamic string paths remain supported and return a broadly-typed object to preserve backwards compatibility (no app code changes required).
  - Other APIs now accept typed paths where applicable: `setValue`, `watch`, `resetField`.

## [3.6.0] - 2025-08-06

### ✨ New Features

- **Pre-compiled CSS Support**: Added optional pre-compiled Tailwind CSS for zero-configuration styling
  - Import `"el-form-react-components/styles.css"` for instant beautiful forms
  - No Tailwind CSS installation required for end users
  - Backwards compatible - existing Tailwind class approach continues to work
  - 31KB minified CSS with semantic `.el-form-*` classes
  - Professional gradient buttons, rounded inputs, focus states, and error styling
